# Data Cleansing API

This project is part of my Data Science project for the Binar Academy Bootcamp. The goal of the project is to create an API that can identify words containing hate speech and clean text data. The API is built using Python, Swagger UI, Flask, and SQLite3. The dataset used for this project consists of non-formal and slang tweets, which are known to often contain hate speech. 

The key features of this project include:

1. Developing a RESTful API using Flask to handle HTTP requests and responses.
2. Utilizing Swagger UI for API documentation and testing.
3. Implementing a machine learning model for hate speech detection.
4. Integrating a SQLite3 database for storing and managing the cleaned text data.

Note: Please be aware that this project contains sensitive content, including hate speech, as it deals with analyzing real-world text data.
